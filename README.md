Have fun!

Technologies used to make this app are HTML5, CSS, Google Fonts API, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery.

To make this app, I used the setInterval JavaScript method and JQuery to show a timer counting down from 90 to 0, one number per second, when the start button is clicked. 

I also used JavaScript and JQuery to create a function that grabs the value of the answers the user has chosen and that displays the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered questions to the user, when the submit button is clicked. 

All of the questions and answers in the trivia game are rendered dynamically using JQuery, when the start button is clicked, rather than being hard coded into the HTML.
